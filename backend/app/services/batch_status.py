"""Multi-sim status lookup — *"give me the current state of these N sims in one call"*.

The publish-gated per-sim surfaces in this codebase answer the question
*"what is sim X doing right now?"* one sim at a time. An integrator
running parallel batches — AntFleet's benchmark pipeline, Capacitr's
polling loop, anyone shipping the ecosystem-table pattern — has to fire
N HTTP requests to poll N sims, which scales poorly the moment the
batch grows past a handful.

``build_batch_status`` collapses that to a single call: it accepts a
list of sim ids (capped at :data:`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`) and returns one
entry per id with the minimum useful state envelope — status, current
round, and (for completed public sims) the same direction +
confidence + quality fields the per-sim ``signal.json`` would emit.
The route handler at ``POST /api/simulation/batch-status`` reads from
here.

Design notes
------------

* **One round-trip per N sims, not N.** The whole reason this surface
  exists is to reduce the request count an integrator needs to poll a
  batch run. The 20-id cap (also documented in
  :data:`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`) is set by the route handler so a runaway
  client can't ask the backend to do 1000 sim reads in one call; the
  service itself accepts any list length the caller passes.

* **Publish gate applied per id, not per batch.** A private sim in
  the batch returns ``found: false`` rather than leaking its fields.
  An unknown sim id (typo, never-existed) returns the same
  ``found: false`` envelope — the integrator cannot distinguish
  "private" from "doesn't exist" from "deleted" by reading the
  response. This is deliberate: the surface is unauthenticated, and
  the existence-of-a-private-sim signal is itself a leak.

* **Status semantics match the rest of the platform.** A sim is
  ``"running"`` when ``state.json.status`` is the string ``"running"``
  (case-insensitive, matching ``platform_status`` and
  ``platform_stats``). ``"completed"`` is the only terminal value
  that earns analytics fields — ``"failed"`` / ``"cancelled"`` /
  any other terminal label returns the bare ``status`` + ``null``
  analytics. A consumer can render the failed badge without the
  signal pretending the sim has a direction.

* **Signal fields are derived, not stored.** ``direction``,
  ``confidence_pct``, ``quality_health`` come from
  :mod:`signal_service.compute_signal` over the same final-round
  belief split the per-sim ``signal.json`` surface uses. Helpers
  duplicate the trajectory-walk pattern from ``platform_stats`` /
  ``project_stats`` byte-for-byte so a sim's batch entry matches its
  per-sim signal entry for the same simulation.

* **``total_rounds`` is the trajectory length.** A completed sim's
  ``total_rounds`` is ``len(trajectory.snapshots)`` — the same value
  ``peak_round.compute_peak_round`` reports. For a running sim
  ``total_rounds`` is ``null`` (the final length is unknown until
  the sim terminates); ``current_round`` is what the state.json
  carries during the run.

* **No cache.** Each request reads the relevant sim folders
  directly. Per-id reads are cheap (a state.json + at most a
  trajectory.json + quality.json), and the route handler caps the
  call at 20 ids, so the worst case is 60 small JSON loads — well
  inside a single tick. An in-process cache would also make the
  result stale, which defeats the polling use case the surface is
  built for. ``Cache-Control: no-store`` is set at the route layer
  for the same reason.

* **Order preserved.** ``results`` is returned in the order the
  caller supplied ``sim_ids``. A duplicate id in the request emits a
  duplicate entry in the response — the service treats the input as
  a list, not a set, so a caller polling the same id twice in the
  same batch gets the same answer twice and can correlate by index.

* **Stdlib only.** ``os`` + ``json`` + ``re``. No new dependencies —
  keeps the platform on its 40-PR zero-new-deps streak. Reuses
  :mod:`signal_service` (already a dep of platform_stats /
  project_stats / per-sim signal.json) so the math is one place.
